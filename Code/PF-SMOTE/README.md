A novel parameter-free SMOTE mechanism to produce sufficiently representative synthetic samples while avoiding interpolated noisy samples. Specifically, two types of minority examples are defined, namely borderline and safe minority examples. The comprehensive sample generation program fully reflects the characteristics of minority group samples, fills in the areas where minority groups dominate, and expands the boundaries of minority groups.
